# ðŸš€ AI/ML Developer | NLP & Computer Vision | Backend Development  

Welcome to my GitHub! I specialize in **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision**, with expertise in:  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- **Generative AI & Agentic AI**  
- **Self-Supervised Learning & Anomaly Detection**  

## ðŸ”¬ Current Work  
I am currently implementing an **unofficial version** of:  
- ðŸ“Œ *[A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709)* (SimCLR)  
and integrating it with:  
- ðŸ“Œ *[Reverse Distillation for Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11325)*  

My goal is to explore **self-supervised learning** for feature extraction and enhance anomaly detection through knowledge distillation.  

## ðŸ–¥ Backend Development  
In addition to AI/ML, I have experience in **backend development**, focusing on:  
- **FastAPI & RESTful APIs**  
- **Scalable AI integrations**  

## ðŸ“Œ Let's Connect  
Feel free to explore my projects and collaborate! ðŸš€
